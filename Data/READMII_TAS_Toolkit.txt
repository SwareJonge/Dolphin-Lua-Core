IMPORTANT information is marked and suggest to be the minimum to read.

This is a compilation of multiple lua scripts for Swarejonge's custom LUA Dolphin Version.

This includes scripts to run the players inputs using an input file and manipulate the racing ghost using an input file, effectively replacing TAS Code.
There is also a script of storing the raw ghost data as both the ghost input file and the runners input file.

This is using the latest MKW_core.lua version

How to use:
-Download Swarejonge's custom LUA Dolphin Version
-Merge this folder with the custom LUA Dolphin version, so that the folder "Scripts" gets merged and MKW_core.lua gets replaced
-Run the Scripts with "Tools > Execute Script"

Credits:
-Swarejonge for his custom Dolphin version and his provided MKW_core.lua
-Star and Swarejonge for help with specific pointers in memory data
-Malleo and TASPlasma for their previous input reader scripts


IMPORTANT: Using MKW_ghost_store_inputs_runner.lua WILL OVERWRITE BOTH RUNNER AND GHOST INPUT FILES. Prepare copies of them if you want to store inputs of a new ghost.
IMPORTANT: MKW_TAS_Toolkit_active_reload.lua RELOADS BOTH INPUT FILES ON EVERY FRAME. This will cause HUGE FRAMEDROPS for running Dolphin normally. ONLY USE WHILE TASING.

Executable Files:
~/Scripts/MKW_GHOST_store_inputs.lua 			--stores the ghosts input from the internal mkw memory into the ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua input file
~/Scripts/MKW_GHOST_store_inputs_runner.lua 	--stores the ghosts input from the internal mkw memory into BOTH ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua AND ~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua input files
~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit.lua					--when loaded, uses the currently saved ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua AND ~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua input files to influence the runners and ghosts inputs, savestate compatible
~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_active_reload.lua		--when loaded, uses ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua AND ~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua input files to influence the runners and ghosts inputs, savestate compatible
												--updates with changing the files in realtime, CAUSES HEAVY FRAMEDROPS, ONLY USE WHILE TASING
~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_input_writer.lua		--writes inputs made with Controller/TAS-Input into the ~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua input file, saves file when script is canceled, savestate compatible
												--keeps old inputs alive, if they are not overwritten, fills gaps between frames with the basic input of no button pressed
~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_rewrite.lua			--rewrites the ~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua input file to match the commentated frames
												--can be run while MKW_TAS_Toolkit_active_reload is active, if you pause the game, start the script and then run the next frame

Helper Files:
~/MKW_core.lua  			--latest MKW_core.lua version, current standard
~/MKW_ghost_core.lua  		--used for pointer finding in all ghost based lua scripts
							--includes basic function to overwrite ghost data using an input list

Input Files:
~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua	--representates the inputs of the ghost
~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua	--representates the inputs of the runner

Test Files:
~/Test_Scripts/TEST_MKW_GHOST_overwrite_data_copy.lua	--converts the ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua input file into binary RKG data saved in the ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost_raw.rrkg file (Raw RKG, does not include header or checksum)
														--made to compare converted inputs with the actual RKG file

Deprecated/Deleted Files:
~/Scripts/MKW_ghost_overwrite.lua				--overwrite the ghost in the internal mkw memory using the ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua input file, DOES NOT affect save data
												--effectively replaced by MKW_TAS_Toolkit.lua


-----------------------
versions:

v1.2
-fixed ~/MKW_ghost_core.lua RKG face button masking
-fixed ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit.lua and ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_active_reload.lua to not crash when frame does not exist
-added ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_rewrite.lua for a quality of life change
-added ~/Test_Scripts/TEST_MKW_GHOST_overwrite_data_copy.lua to write raw RKG data into a file
-not mentioned v1.1 changes:
	-added ~/MKW_Pointers.lua for some global race data pointers__by Swarejonge
	-updated ~/MKW_ghost_core.lua for ghost data pointers of other ISO-regions__by Swarejonge

v1.1 
-swapped position of horizontal and vertical inputs
-updated ~/MKW_core.lua to match latest version__by Swarejonge 
-updated ~/Scripts/MKW_GHOST_store_inputs.lua and ~/Scripts/MKW_GHOST_store_inputs_runner.lua to be able to convert *.RKG files corrupted by "Ghost always saves"-code
-updated ~/MKW_ghost_core.lua to refactor the ghost overwriting function
-updated ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit.lua and ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_active_reload.lua:
	-ghost and/or runner files will now only be read, if they are existing
	-deleting the ~/mkw_input_reader_runner.lua will cause to only replace ghost in the memory, effectively replacing the deprecated ~/Scripts/MKW_ghost_overwrite.lua
	-deleting the ~/mkw_input_reader_ghost.lua will cause to only the runner inputs to be run
	-deleting both input files will effectively do nothing
-updated ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_active_reload.lua to surely only reload, when a savestate or new frame is loaded
-added ~/Scripts/MKW_TAS_Toolkit_input_writer.lua as a new support for TASing with Controller/TAS-Input

v1
-initial release
